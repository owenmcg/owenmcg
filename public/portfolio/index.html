        <h1>Hello</h1>
      </header>
      
	      <p>
	      Thank you for taking the time to take a look at my work. Below is a brief professional bio and a number of projects I feel best represent my skills and talents.
	      </p>
	      <h2>Synopsis</h2>
	      <p>
	      I have been working as a creative professional for over 12 years and have spent the last 10 working primarily in publishing for the Agricultural Trust. The Trust publish a number of newspapers and magazines, such as the Irish Farmers Journal and Irish Country Magazine.</p>
	      <p>Working to a minimum of three deadlines a week has given me a solid work ethic and puts a focus on getting things done. I am comfortable working on projects from concept through to design and delivery. With an extensive knowledge across many disciplines, cross-media design and strategy are core strengths of mine. I have professional experience and proficiency in print design, photo retouching/compositing, web design, HTML and CSS, video and audio production, shooting, editing and grading and motion graphics. In a nutshell, I am a generalist with several areas of expertise. I am comfortable working on multiple simultaneous projects with overlapping deadlines.
	      </p>
	      <h2>Relevant work</h2>

	      <h3 id="qma">NDC & Kerrygold Quality Milk Awards</h3>
	      <p>The NDC and Kerrygold wanted to create a more engaging and vibrant campaign for the 2015 Quality Milk Awards. As creative lead on this project I worked closely with a small in-house team, as well as the client. I initially conceived the idea of a campaign which represented the community that is the dairy farming industry. As much as they are fiercely competitive, they are also on the same team. From a number of workshops with the client we settled on the #MADEFORTHIS campaign; borne out of an early edit I did of a video of 2014 winner Thomas Dwan. I was responsible for the overall design and look and feel of the campaign.</p>
	      <p>In terms of production work I was heavily involved in the creation of the videos below. From pre-production—concepting, storyboarding, creating a client brief, hiring and prepping the audio and video gear. Through to production—one of two primary shooters, all audio and interview recording and drone flying/footage. And finally post-production—all video editing, audio editing, colour correction, graphics and output and delivery of final assets.</p>

	      <h3 id="quantified">Quantified Self (Personal project)</h3>
	      <p>
	      Ever since seeing Nicholas Felton’s 2012 Annual Report I have become increasingly curious and fascinated by the notion of the “quantified self”. I began using the Reporter app—designed and developed by Nicholas Felton and Drew Breunig—upon its release in February 2014. All of the data
presented in the following experiment has been collected with this app.</p>
		<p>This project is as much a data experiment as it is a social and design experiment. I was interested to see if I would glean anything notable about myself and my interaction with the world, while at the same time setting myself the challenge of presenting the information in a meaninul and
engaging way.</p>

	      <h3 id="grass">Grass (Side project)</h3>
	      <p><em>Grass</em> is a concept that was borne out of Clay Christensen's <a href="http://www.christenseninstitute.org/key-concepts/jobs-to-be-done/">jobs-to-be-done framework</a>. It is a companion app for the working farmer. Grass measurement is an important and emerging part of the livestock farming process, particularly dairy. The <em>Grass</em> app is a concept focusing on simplicity. Its aim is to make valuable business information simple to record and easy to disseminate.</p>
	      <img src="images/grass-sketch.png">
	      <iframe src="https://marvelapp.com/69gb546?emb=1" width="402" height="823" allowTransparency="true" frameborder="0"></iframe>
	      <p>
	      <em>Grass</em> is very much a work in progress. On the design front I am currently refining it down and doing my best to channel Edward Tufte. I am also currently working with a dairy PhD graduate on the functionality of the app.

	      <h3 id="wicklow">Illustration series (Personal project)</h3>
	      <p>
	      I'm a big fan of my small home town of Wicklow. Together with my wife we produced a series of illustrated, limited run prints, celebrating some of the local landmarks.</p>

	      The Long Acre
	      </h3>
	      <p>
	      This was a project borne out of the desire to take photographic jobs that had been reduced to one image in print and give them life by publishing them online as deeper, richer photo stories.
	      </p>
	      <img src="images/the-long-acre-logo.png">
	      <p>
	      The concept quickly evolved from a photo blog, to a standalone section of the Farmers Journal website. The working title of the project was <em>The Long Acre</em> and I created the logo above for it.
	      </p>
	      <img src="images/the-long-acre-style-tile.jpg">
	      <p class="caption">Initial style tile for The Long Acre.</p>
	      <p>
	      We had a good idea of the look and feel we were going for so I put together a style tile as a platform to build further design iterations out from.
	      </p>

	      <p class="caption">Early wireframes for the project (created in Illustrator).</p>
	      <p>
	      The concept of the project developed further with the inclusion of a <em>Reader's Submissions</em> section – focusing on user submitted content – and a <em>From the Archive</em> section – showcasing images from the 50+ year photo archive. Although the photo stories would remain the core content, the additional sections allowed for a greater diversity in content, while opening a dialogue with the users.

	      <p>
	      From an early stage it was apparent that creating a revenue stream would be valuable. After seeing the success of The Deck network in it's niche market I worked on an idea for a bespoke digital advertising platform aimed squarely at the agricultural sector. It was dubbed The Yard and I created a logo that tied in with project as a whole.
	      </p>
	      <img src="images/the-yard-logo.png">
	      <p>
	      During the development of the project I put together a project proposal for both The Long Acre and The Yard, as well as creating a resource plan assessing our current resources and outlining a plan for the future of the project. The project was presented using a Powerpoint presentation where I had video samples of how the site would function, which were created in After Effects.

	      <h3 id="toplinkv1">Toplink V1.0</h3>
	      <p>
	      Toplink was a full rebrand and relaunch of the online classified ads for the Irish Farmers Journal. I was brought in at a late stage of the project and created 60+ icons for each of the sections and to also create some ad concepts for the product.

	      <h3 id="ifjwip">Irish Farmers Journal rebrand (Side project)</h3>
	      <p>
	      This is an unsolicited redesign of the Irish Farmers Journal homepage. The idea behind the design is to try and compartmentalise the content into modules from which the reader can pick and choose. Each section can collapse into it's header, allowing the reader to choose how they want to read the edition of the publication. I have used actual content from the paper to get a real feel for how it will sit in the design. This is also in a state of WIP.
