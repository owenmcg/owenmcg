        	<h1>D&D</h1>
      	</header>
<p>My first foray into role playing games was <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4045493-fighting-fantasy">Fighting Fantasy Role-play</a>. Naturally with Steve Jackson as the author it is a beautifully solid and entertaining book that is the perfect intro into the RPG world for young minds.</p>

<p><img src="http://owenmcg.com/images/fighting-fantasy.png" alt="Fighting Fantasy RPG and Advanced Fighting Fantasy RPG" /></p>

<p>From here I moved into Advanced Fighting Fantasy and then finally graduated into the grim and perilous world of Warhammer Fantasy Role Play 1st Edition (WFRP).</p>

<p><img src="http://owenmcg.com/images/wfrp.png" alt="Warhammer Fantasy Role Play 1st Edition" /></p>

<p>WFRP became our go-to RPG. Myself and my friends played it diligently for years. I still love this game and it has never lost that nostalgic draw for me. The artwork, the setting, the careers system. It has its flaws, but it is a superb game and one I will revisit in the future. It is currently in its <a href="https://www.cubicle7games.com/our-games/warhammer-fantasy-roleplay/">4th edition</a> and Cubicle 7 seem to be doing a good job with it.</p>

<p>So bearing all of the above in mind I never managed to play Dungeons &amp; Dragons (or Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons). It was on our radar, but the rules were a bit tricky and the world was too rich for my taste. I prefer low fantasy and D&amp;D had too many races and too many planes of existence etc. for my liking. WFRP was basically medieval Europe with elves, dwarves, halflings, a bit of magic and a bunch of monsters. No real need to get into the lore.</p>

<p>Thus D&amp;D became a game I never had any interest in playing. Until recently. One of my board gaming friends was looking for a small group of RPGers to run a D&amp;D campaign. So I bit the bullet and decided to go all in and give it a shot.</p>

<p>We had our Session 0 and my character is a (puny) level 1 human wizard desperate for power. In an unlikely turn of events he is adventuring with a thief (human) and an ex-military sergeant (human). None of us have played for years, so we got off to a bumpy start, but it was really enjoyable. My wizard had to flee from our first fight, our thief was critically wounded and our soldier saved the day!</p>

<p>My first impressions of D&amp;D are decent. There is a bit of a learning curve in character creation and not knowing what number you are rolling to hit in combat kind of dulls the drama a bit. But it is early days and we’re still getting too grips with it all.</p>

<p>I hope to post updates on the campaign as we go, let’s see what happens…</p>
