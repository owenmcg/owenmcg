        <h1>Hello</h1>
      </header>
      
	      <p>
	      Thank you for taking the time to take a look at my work. Below is a brief professional bio and a number of projects I feel best represent my skills and talents.
	      </p>
	      <h2>Synopsis</h2>
	      <p>
	      I have been working as a creative professional for over 12 years and have spent the last 10 working primarily in publishing for the Agricultural Trust. The Trust publish a number of newspapers and magazines, such as the Irish Farmers Journal and Irish Country Magazine.</p>
	      <p>Working to a minimum of three deadlines a week has given me a solid work ethic and puts a focus on getting things done. I am comfortable working on projects from concept through to design and delivery. With an extensive knowledge across many disciplines, cross-media design and strategy is a core strength of mine. I have professional experience and proficiency in print design, photo retouching/compositing, web design, HTML and CSS, video and audio production, shooting, editing and grading. In a nutshell, I am a generalist with several areas of expertise. I am comfortable working on multiple simultaneous projects with overlapping deadlines.
	      </p>

	      I have been a geek as long as I remember. Starting out with Steve Jackson and Ian Livingstone's <a href="http://fightingfantasy.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=8&Itemid=9">Fighting Fantasy</a> series, moving gradually on to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A54blk-ojA4">computer</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29TaGhYZZlA">games</a> and finally, finding my spiritual home in technology. I had my HTML epiphany in 1999 and have continued to have many more as the years went on (accessibility, <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/">CSS for layout</a>, <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design/">responsive design</a>, web fonts). The web really is the gift that keeps on giving (if not a bit relentlessly!). Being predominantly self-taught I have delved into a good few areas of design and production with reasonable depth, but always felt drawn to the web.
	      </p>
	      <p>
	      Professionally I currently practice <a href="https://vimeo.com/owenmcg/videos">photo retouching & compositing and video production</a> (shooting, editing and publishing). I also manage the front and back-end aspects of the photo archive and production workflow and have worked as a designer and front-end coder on a few in-house web projects. I'll leave it there for now as this nutshell is getting a bit cramped!

	      The Long Acre
	      </h3>
	      <p>
	      This was a project borne out of the desire to take photographic jobs that had been reduced to one image in print and give them life by publishing them online as deeper, richer photo stories.
	      </p>
	      <img src="images/the-long-acre-logo.png">
	      <p>
	      The concept quickly evolved from a photo blog, to a standalone section of the Farmers Journal website. The working title of the project was <em>The Long Acre</em> and I created the logo above for it.
	      </p>
	      <img src="images/the-long-acre-style-tile.jpg">
	      <p class="caption">Initial style tile for The Long Acre.</p>
	      <p>
	      We had a good idea of the look and feel we were going for so I put together a style tile as a platform to build further design iterations out from.
	      </p>

	      <p class="caption">Early wireframes for the project (created in Illustrator).</p>
	      <p>
	      The concept of the project developed further with the inclusion of a <em>Reader's Submissions</em> section – focusing on user submitted content – and a <em>From the Archive</em> section – showcasing images from the 50+ year photo archive. Although the photo stories would remain the core content, the additional sections allowed for a greater diversity in content, while opening a dialogue with the users.

	      <p>
	      From an early stage it was apparent that creating a revenue stream would be valuable. After seeing the success of The Deck network in it's niche market I worked on an idea for a bespoke digital advertising platform aimed squarely at the agricultural sector. It was dubbed The Yard and I created a logo that tied in with project as a whole.
	      </p>
	      <img src="images/the-yard-logo.png">
	      <p>
	      During the development of the project I put together a project proposal for both The Long Acre and The Yard, as well as creating a resource plan assessing our current resources and outlining a plan for the future of the project. The project was presented using a Powerpoint presentation where I had video samples of how the site would function, which were created in After Effects.
	      </p>

	      <h3 id="toplinkv1">Toplink V1.0</h3>
	      <p>
	      Toplink was a full rebrand and relaunch of the online classified ads for the Irish Farmers Journal. I was brought in at a late stage of the project and created 60+ icons for each of the sections and to also create some ad concepts for the product.

	      <h3 id="grass">Grass (Side-project)</h3>
	      <p>I have been chipping away at different ideas for in-the-field (no pun intended) companion apps for the working farmer. Grass measurement is an important and emerging part of the livestock farming process, particularly dairy. The <em>Grass</em> app is a concept focusing on simplicity. Makes recording information simple and easy to disseminate.</p>
	      <img src="images/grass-sketch.png">
	      <p>
	      <em>Grass</em> is very much a work in progress. On the design front I am currently refining it down and doing my best to channel Edward Tufte. I am also currently working with a dairy PhD graduate on the functionality of the app.
	      </p>
	      <p class="previous-int"><a href="#projectlist">Back to project list</a></p>
	      
	      <!--<h3 id="workflow">Workflow</h3>
	      <p>I used to think I was lazy, until I realised that I just hate unnecessary repetition or redundancy. I have a borderline obsession with workflows and am constantly looking for ways to cut away cruft and let a system flow. Below is a schematic I put together for a redesigned production workflow for the Irish Farmers Journal.</p>
	      <img src="images/ifj-production-workflow.png">
	      <p>
	      This was a complete overhaul of what was a predominantly email based system. After designing the overall workflow I then implemented it using a suite of front-end and back-end software developed by Fotoware. Users interact with the system (upload, search and download) via browser and plugin based front-end modules. All of the leg work on the back-end is done using a combination of metadata and hot folders to manage auto-routing of files through the system.
	      </p>
	      <img src="images/CMS_IFJ_workflow.png">
	      <p>
	      The schematic above was a workflow that I designed and implemented to work in tandem with a custom CMS that the Farmers Journal commissioned. The out-sourced agency couldn't find a solution that would allow us to continue exploiting our use of metadata in our photo archive. The above workflow bridged the gap between our existing setup and the custom CMS and allowed contributors to add imagery directly to the system from an offsite location for the first time. It also reduced the amount of friction that would be felt in print production when the new CMS was rolled out.
	      </p>
	      <p>
	      I am currently working on an idea for a print/digital CMS centred around a Markdown based workflow.

	      <h3 id="ifjwip">Irish Farmers Journal rebrand (Side-project)</h3>
	      <p>
	      This is an unsolicited redesign of the Irish Farmers Journal homepage. The idea behind the design is to try and compartmentalise the content into modules from which the reader can pick and choose. Each section can collapse into it's header, allowing the reader to choose how they want to read the edition of the publication. I have used actual content from the paper to get a real feel for how it will sit in the design. This is also in a state of WIP.
