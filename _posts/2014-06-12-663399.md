This is a post in response to the loss of the [Meyer family's six year old daughter Rebecca](https://twitter.com/meyerweb/status/475423495178838016) and [Jeffrey Zeldman's blog post](http://www.zeldman.com/2014/06/10/the-color-purple/) asking us to do the most ‘heartbreakingly inadequate’ thing in memory of Rebecca. For today, Thursday 12th of June 2014, my site will be going purple.

I came to know of Eric back in the early 2000s due to his open and honest approach to his work. The frank, open approach that the Meyer's took to their daughter's illness is one of the bravest and most trusting things I have seen on the web. I feel privileged to have been allowed to follow a part Rebecca's life.

This gesture feels so infinitesmally small, but if it can contribute to a global remembrance of Rebecca, then it is worth it.

My heart goes out the Meyer family, I cannot even begin to understand the pain they are going through.
