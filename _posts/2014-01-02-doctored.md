With a little bit of extra free-time over Christmas I managed to crack the [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com "Jekyll: Static site generator") nut.

I am still working on getting my setup to work with [Compass](http://compass-style.org), but all in all I'm pretty happy with it. When I get a bit more time I might write a post about getting it all up and running; purely from the point of view of a rusty, part-timer like myself and the problems I ran into.

The collapse of my old blog's database has had somewhat of a silver lining. I've rebuilt my site and reignited my love of web design/coding. I also have an interesting collaborative side project on the go, so fingers crossed 2014 gets off to a good start.
