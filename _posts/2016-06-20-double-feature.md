I have a real soft spot for retro science fiction artwork. The aspiration of what we thought the future might be is fascinating.

Recently enough I started following a Twitter account called [70‘s Sci-Fi Art](https://twitter.com/70sscifiart). It’s pretty good, but every now and then there are some real gems. And it was through this account I stumbled across the work of [Peter Elson](http://www.peterelson.co.uk/biography/index.php).

Elson’s work

Sadly Peter died at a bar in his 50s after working on some murals with his colleagues. I think his work speaks for itself.
