As of January this year I became an official (t-shirt owning) member of [The Last Chancers](https://www.facebook.com/groups/307975052636896/) gaming club.

Myself and a couple of other Last Chancers lean more heavily towards the board gaming side of things and decided to start running the inventively titled “Board Game Thursday”. Cryptically, this would be a Thursday where we would run board games.

To try and get a bit more momentum behind each night I decided to throw a poster together for each one. Below are the fruits of my labours.
