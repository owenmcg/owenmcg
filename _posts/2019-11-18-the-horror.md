title: The Horror
---
In my quest for a simple <abbr title="Role Playing Games">RPG</abbr> that focused less on mechanics and more on story I stumbled across [Cthulhu Dark](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/78929588/cthulhu-dark).

It was the beautiful work of [Guilherme Gontijo](https://gontijo.itch.io/) that introduced me to Cthulhu Dark. I'm not a huge fan of H.P Lovecraft, but this book could just have easily been called ‘Dark’ and dropped the Cthulhu bit. It focuses on the horror and have an [outrageously simple system](http://catchyourhare.com/files/Cthulhu%20Dark.pdf). This makes it perfect for running really snappy one-shot mysteries.

I've been kicking a horror story around in my head for quite some time now and Cthulhu Dark is the first RPG that has kicked me into gear to actually finish writing the thing. I think the simplicity of the system allows you to just write the story, create the hooks and let the story play out from there. Hopefully I will finish writing it in the next few weeks. I'll post updates as I go.

But for now here is a tiny taster of what is to come.
