I"Ð<p>In my quest for a simple <abbr title="Role Playing Game">RPG</abbr> that focused less on mechanics and more on story I stumbled across <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/78929588/cthulhu-dark">Cthulhu Dark</a>.</p>

<p>It was the beautiful work of <a href="https://gontijo.itch.io/">Guilherme Gontijo</a> that introduced me to Cthulhu Dark. Iâ€™m not a huge fan of H.P Lovecraft, but this book could just have easily been called â€˜Darkâ€™ and dropped the Cthulhu bit. It focuses on the horror and has an <a href="http://catchyourhare.com/files/Cthulhu%20Dark.pdf">outrageously simple system</a>. This makes it perfect for running really snappy one-shot mysteries.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve been kicking a horror story around in my head for quite some time now and Cthulhu Dark is the first RPG that has kicked me into gear to actually finish writing the thing. I think the simplicity of the system allows you to just write the story, create the hooks and let the story play out from there. Hopefully I will finish writing it in the next few weeks. Iâ€™ll post updates as I go.</p>

<p>But for now here is a tiny taster of what is to come.</p>
