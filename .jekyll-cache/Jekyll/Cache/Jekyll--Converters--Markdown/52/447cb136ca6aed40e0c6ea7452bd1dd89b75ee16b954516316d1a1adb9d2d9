I"F<p>As a father to a 4 year old girl I feel it is my duty to, not necessarily discourage dolls and pink, but to encourage dragons, pirates and general adventure.</p>

<p>So naturally I was delighted when my daughterâ€™s first drawing with real purpose was that of a monster. He has four eyes, a crooked grin, two little arms and plenty of legs.</p>

<p class="caption">He really is quite the monster :)</p>

<p>Once I had finished getting all choked up, as you do over anything even remotely significant that your child does, I thought that it would make quite a cool logo. So, I chucked this together in Illustrator for a rainy day, or the day I pluck up the courage to set up my own little business.</p>
