I"$<p>As of January this year I became an official (t-shirt owning) member of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/307975052636896/">The Last Chancers</a> gaming club.</p>

<p>Myself and a couple of other Last Chancers lean more heavily towards the board gaming side of things and decided to start running the inventively titled “Board Game Thursday”. Cryptically, this would be a Thursday where we would run board games.</p>

<p>To try and get a bit more momentum behind each night I decided to throw a poster together for each one. Below are the fruits of my labours.</p>
