I"å<p>This is a post in response to the loss of the <a href="https://twitter.com/meyerweb/status/475423495178838016">Meyer familyâ€™s six year old daughter Rebecca</a> and <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/2014/06/10/the-color-purple/">Jeffrey Zeldmanâ€™s blog post</a> asking us to do the most â€˜heartbreakingly inadequateâ€™ thing in memory of Rebecca. For today, Thursday 12th of June 2014, my site will be going purple.</p>

<p>I came to know of Eric back in the early 2000s due to his open and honest approach to his work. The frank, open approach that the Meyerâ€™s took to their daughterâ€™s illness is one of the bravest and most trusting things I have seen on the web. I feel privileged to have been allowed to follow a part Rebeccaâ€™s life.</p>

<p>This gesture feels so infinitesmally small, but if it can contribute to a global remembrance of Rebecca, then it is worth it.</p>

<p>My heart goes out the Meyer family, I cannot even begin to understand the pain they are going through.</p>
