I"\<p>I have a real soft spot for retro science fiction artwork. The aspiration of what we thought the future might be is fascinating.</p>

<p>Recently enough I started following a Twitter account called <a href="https://twitter.com/70sscifiart">70‘s Sci-Fi Art</a>. It’s pretty good, but every now and then there are some real gems. And it was through this account I stumbled across the work of <a href="http://www.peterelson.co.uk/biography/index.php">Peter Elson</a>.</p>

<p>Elson’s work</p>

<p>Sadly Peter died at a bar in his 50s after working on some murals with his colleagues. I think his work speaks for itself.</p>
