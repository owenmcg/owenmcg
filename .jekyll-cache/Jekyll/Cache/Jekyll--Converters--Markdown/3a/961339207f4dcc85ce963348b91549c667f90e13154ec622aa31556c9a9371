I"ü<p>With a little bit of extra free-time over Christmas I managed to crack the <a href="http://jekyllrb.com" title="Jekyll: Static site generator">Jekyll</a> nut.</p>

<p>I am still working on getting my setup to work with <a href="http://compass-style.org">Compass</a>, but all in all Iâ€™m pretty happy with it. When I get a bit more time I might write a post about getting it all up and running; purely from the point of view of a rusty, part-timer like myself and the problems I ran into.</p>

<p>The collapse of my old blogâ€™s database has had somewhat of a silver lining. Iâ€™ve rebuilt my site and reignited my love of web design/coding. I also have an interesting collaborative side project on the go, so fingers crossed 2014 gets off to a good start.</p>
